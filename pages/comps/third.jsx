I never knew what true love was until I met you. Every day with you is a blessing and I am so excited to continue building a life together filled with love, laughter, and adventures.</p>
		<p>I want you to know that I am here for you, always and forever. No matter what challenges we may face, I will always be by your side, holding your hand and supporting you every step of the way. I love you more than words could ever express and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life making you smile.</p>

			love prevails,
